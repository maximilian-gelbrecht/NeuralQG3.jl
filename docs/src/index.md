## Installation 

This package depends on several unregistered packages. Julia 1.11 should be able to instantiate those as their URLs are given in the respective `Project.toml` files. If this isn't working or you are using an older Julia version, please inspect the `[sources]` section of `Project.toml` and add those unregistered packages manually. 

The packages also uses Git LFS for storing some input data. After cloning the packing pull the data with `git lfs fetch --all`.
